# ZALF AR Cookbook

Welcome to the project website of the ZALF Cookbook AR-App. 
The project presented on this website was developed during the winter semester 22/23 at [Filmuniversität Babelsberg KONRAD WOLF](https://www.filmuniversitaet.de) as part of a teaching and research cooperation between the [Leibniz-Zentrum für Agrarlandschaftsforschung (ZALF) e.V.](https://www.zalf.de/de/Seiten/ZALF.aspx) and the Filmuniversität. 

The ZALF AR Cookbook app is a prototypical AR application that can be used in combination with a specific recipe (see the [documentation page](documentation) for more details). 
The recipe is based on ingredients that promote sustainable cultivation. In combination with the AR app, users learn through a simple animation how the ingredients have a positive impact on the environment and the associated ecological processes. 

**What the ZALF AR Cookbook app achieves is unique. It allows  
ZALF to communicate research results in an accessible way and puts them into an everyday context. 
Users gain knowledge about sustainable agriculture and can contribute to the sustainable use of food.**
