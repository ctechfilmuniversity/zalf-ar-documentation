# NAME TBD

The project presented on this website was developed during the winter semester 22/23 at [Filmuniversität Babelsberg KONRAD WOLF](https://www.filmuniversitaet.de) as part of a teaching and research cooperation between the [Leibniz-Zentrum für Agrarlandschaftsforschung (ZALF) e.V.](https://www.zalf.de/de/Seiten/ZALF.aspx) and the Filmuniversität. 

The overarching thematic focus of the cooperation is science communication. For this purpose, the two institutions were to get to know each other in an initial project and develop a concept for the transfer of ZALF research results to society. The central topic of the project was identified as the research focus on "sustainable agriculture" and, in particular, the findings relating to the cultivation of legumes. Through the latter, a contribution to improved processing of carbon in the atmosphere and thus reduced environmental impact can be achieved.
